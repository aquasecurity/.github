Our [community meetings](https://hackmd.io/v0x8w2RoQM2N-M_UfSByRQ) are open to all, you are welcome to join us! 

## Issues

- Feel free to open an issue for any reason as long as you make it clear if the issue is about a bug/feature/question/comment.

- Remember, users might be searching for your issue in the future. So please give it a meaningful title to help others.
- The issue should clearly explain the reason for opening the proposal if you have any, along with any relevant technical information.
- For questions and bug reports, please include the output you're seeing (using debug logging where possible) and describe what is different from what you expected to see.
